# 📘 Assignment: Python Basics

## 🎯 Objective

Practice fundamental Python programming skills including user input, string formatting, arithmetic operations, and conditional statements by implementing simple functions.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ User Input and String Formatting

#### Description
Write a function called `welcome_message()` that interacts with the user and returns a formatted welcome message.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Ask the user for their name, age, and favorite color using `input()`.

- Ask the user to enter two numbers.
- Add the numbers together.
- Print the result. Example:

Write a function called `is_even()` that checks if a number is even.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Take a single integer argument.
- Return `True` if the number is even, and `False` if it is odd.
- Example usage:
